# Description

We were tasked with developing a price quote project in which there would be multiple functionalities like register, profile update, login, quote fuel price and show quote history. We are using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for our frontend because these technologies together form an interactive website, with PHP handling server-side logic, HTML laying out the structure, CSS customizing the presentation, and JavaScript adding dynamic functionalities. We are using PHP Laravel, JavaScript, and Ajax as backend technologies. Laravel provides a robust, scalable framework for building complex web applications with PHP, offering built-in functionalities like authentication, routing, and session management.
